  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the `User` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Transaction` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
